# Notes

This is mainly just a collection my persnoal notes as well as some useful resources I have come across on the internet.

- [CD Ripping Terminology](https://docs.linn.co.uk/wiki/index.php/CD_Ripping_Terminology). Information about the different kinds of jitter (EFM, Sampling, and Read Offset) and error correction.
